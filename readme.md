Alright so this is a much anticipated module for me by me 

##How it works ?

The same way our brain does!
It has neurons which parse a whole wikipedia document and get / fetch output from it
its IQ & Responces are equivalent to what a really dumb person will say so far but
for being a neural network its IQ increases with every question. So in about 3 years we shall
have an einstien ;D ;D.

#SO HOW DOES IT WORKS ?

okay now lets get to code part.

It mantains a neural network . So what ?
A neural network is just as our brain is a collection of neurons , our brain is pretty complex
but its best use is for pattern matching [ where it is really unbeatable ]. So whats the cool thing ? 
This module is replicating our brain ;D
